WebService-Livedoor-SpamChampuru-DNSBL

Checks if an IP has recently been used for sending spams, using DNSBL server at dnsbl.spam-champuru.livedoor.com.

dnsbl.spam-champuru.livedoor.com holds IPs which have been reported as sources of spams by various services running at livedoor.com.

The list of IPs are mainly collected from blog, bbs and wiki services. (Should work well for checking spam trackbacks/comments for blogs, but may not suit for filtering mails).
